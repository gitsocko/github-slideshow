		<h1>Brewed Awakening</h1>
		<h2>Where coffee isn't just a drink, it's a lifesaver!		</h2>
		<p>It happens millions of times each week - a customer receives a drink from a BA barista - but each interaction is unique.</p>
		<p>It's just a moment in time - just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.</p>
		<p>But it's a connection.</p>
		<p>We make sure everything we do honors that connection - from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.</p>
		<p>From our beginnings as a single store over forty years ago, in every place that we've been, and every place that we touch, we've tried to make it a little better than we found it.</p>
